If the file does not already exist then an attempt will be made to create it. rws 	Open for reading and writing, as with rw, and also require that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. rwd 	Open for reading and writing, as with rw, and also require that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device.
HTTP requires all request properties which can legally have multiple instances with the same key to use a comma-seperated list syntax which enables multiple properties to be appended into a single property.
The behavior of aforementioned conversion process can be adjusted by various flags: If the ALLOW_UNASSIGNED flag is used, the domain name string to be converted can contain code points that are unassigned in Unicode 3.2, which is the Unicode version on which IDN conversion is based. If the flag is not used, the presence of such unassigned code points is treated as an error. If the USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES flag is used, ASCII strings are checked against RFC 1122 and RFC 1123. It is an error if they don't meet the requirements.
If the system property java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer is defined, then the value is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete implementation class, which must implement Packer.

This method can handle both label and entire domain name, by assuming that labels in a domain name are always separated by dots.
It is assumed that all characters in the encoded string are one of the following: a through z, A through Z, 0 through 9, and -, _, ., and *. The character % is allowed but is interpreted as the start of a special escaped sequence.
Whether aliases are case sensitive is implementation dependent. In order to avoid problems, it is recommended not to use aliases in a KeyStore that only differ in case.
A URL can optionally specify a port, which is the port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for http is 80. An alternative port could be specified as: http://www.socs.uts.edu.au:80/MosaicDocs-old/url-primer.html

The atomic classes also support method weakCompareAndSet, which has limited applicability. On some platforms, the weak version may be more efficient than compareAndSet in the normal case, but differs in that any given invocation of the weakCompareAndSet method may return false spuriously (that is, for no apparent reason). A false return means only that the operation may be retried if desired, relying on the guarantee that repeated invocation when the variable holds expectedValue and no other thread is also attempting to set the variable will eventually succeed.

Users of SWT.VIRTUAL should also avoid using getItems() from the Table within the TreeViewer as this does not necessarily generate a callback for the TreeViewer to populate the items. It also has the side effect of creating all of the items thereby eliminating the performance improvements of SWT.VIRTUAL.

An application should not normally try to catch ThreadDeath unless it must do some extraordinary cleanup operation (note that the throwing of ThreadDeath causes finally clauses of try statements to be executed before the thread officially dies). If a catch clause catches a ThreadDeath object, it is important to rethrow the object so that the thread actually dies.
Granting AllPermission should be done with extreme care, as it implies all other permissions. Thus, it grants code the ability to run with security disabled. Extreme caution should be taken before granting such a permission to code. This permission should be used only during testing, or in extremely rare cases where an application or applet is completely trusted and adding the necessary permissions to the policy is prohibitively cumbersome.
@noinstantiate This class is not intended to be instantiated by clients.

In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to save and restore the state of the non-serializable class.
The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: It must write each of the attributes of the SQL type to the given output stream. This is done by calling a method of the output stream to write each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. Specifically, it must call the appropriate SQLOutput writer method(s) (writeInt, writeString, and so on) to do the following: for a Distinct Type, write its single data element; for a Structured Type, write a value for each attribute of the SQL type.

In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
SocketPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any orde
They therefore must either be parsed as such or treated as an error.

All execution methods in the Statement interface implicitly close a statment's current ResultSet object if an open one exists.
Instances of classes that implement this interface must implement an equals() method that equates any two instances that share the same generic type declaration and have equal type parameters.
A valid reduction polynomial is either a trinomial (X^m + X^k + 1 with m > k >= 1) or a pentanomial (X^m + X^k3 + X^k2 + X^k1 + 1 with m > k3 > k2 > k1 >= 1), so ks should have length 1 or 3.
Note: By definition, the execution of positioned updates and deletes must be done by a different Statement object than the one that generated the ResultSet object being used for positioning.
Creating a type variable must not cause the creation of its bounds. Repeated creation of a type variable has no effect.
However, all instances representing a type variable must be equal() to each other.
When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.
When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.
This map enforces the restriction that there is a 1:1 relation between keys and values, meaning that multiple keys cannot map to the same value. This is required so that inverting the map results in a map without duplicate keys.
The general contract of flush is that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously written have been buffered by the implementation of the output stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their intended destination.
The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
A JDBC driver must apply this limit to the execute, executeQuery and executeUpdate methods.
The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly, that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements (as defined above).
Implementations are encouraged to make regular use of Assert.isNotNull to ensure that null parameters are detected as early as possible.
Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved into the same IP addresses; else if either host name can't be resolved, the host names must be equal without regard to case; or both host names equal to null.
For two URIs to be considered equal requires that either both are opaque or both are hierarchical. Their schemes must either both be undefined or else be equal without regard to case. Their fragments must either both be undefined or else be equal. For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific parts must be equal. For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and their user-information components must be equal.

Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures
A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long
The implementor must ensure sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x)) for all x and y. (This implies that x.compareTo(y) must throw an exception iff y.compareTo(x) throws an exception.) The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: (x.compareTo(y)>0 && y.compareTo(z)>0) implies x.compareTo(z)>0. Finally, the implementor must ensure that x.compareTo(y)==0 implies that sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z)), for all z.
If markpos is not -1, then all bytes from positions buf[markpos] through buf[pos-1] must remain in the buffer array
. Should only succeed once per remote call.
Calling disconnect() should not imply that this HttpURLConnection instance can be reused for other requests.
The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: * It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL type from the given input stream. This is done by calling a method of the input stream to read each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. * The method readSQL then assigns the data to appropriate fields or elements (of this or other objects). Specifically, it must call the appropriate reader method (SQLInput.readString, SQLInput.readBigDecimal, and so on) method(s) to do the following: for a distinct type, read its single data element; for a structured type, read a value for each attribute of the SQL type.
A PKIXCertPathChecker must support reverse checking and may support forward checking.
The general contract of hashCode is: * Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. * If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. * It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.
Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.
# codesource must not be null. # If this object's certificates are not null, then all of this object's certificates must be present in codesource's certificates. # If this object's location (getLocation()) is not null, then the following checks are made against this object's location and codesource's: 1. codesource's location must not be null. 2. If this object's location equals codesource's location, then return true. 3. This object's protocol (getLocation().getProtocol()) must be equal to codesource's protocol. 4. If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null, then the SocketPermission constructed with this object's host must imply the SocketPermission constructed with codesource's host. 5. If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal codesource's port. 6. If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal codesource's file, then the following checks are made: If this object's file ends with /-, then codesource's file must start with this object's file (exclusive the trailing -). If this object's file ends with a /*, then codesource's file must start with this object's file and must not have any further / separators. If this object's file doesn't end with a /, then codesource's file must match this object's file with a '/' appended. 7. If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is not null, it must equal codesource's reference.
Format subclasses that are aware of Field should give precedence to attribute and ignore fieldID if attribute is not null.
When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a user can load and register a driver by calling Class.forName(foo.bah.Driver)
The reliability of this method is important for the ability to use it to make security decisions, so its implementation should not just test if the class in question extends Proxy.
A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
@param input the object to be transformed, should be left unchanged
Implementations should seek to avoid creating a new object every time this method is called.
When you are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are treated as equivalent. In addition, you must handle characters with more than one accent.
@param classfileBuffer the input byte buffer in class file format - must not be modified
A PKIXCertPathChecker implementation must support reverse checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the reverse direction) and may support forward checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the forward direction).
For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the suffixes must be distinct for DecimalFormat.parse() to be able to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then DecimalFormat will behave as if no negative subpattern was specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.
The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
A certificate/CRL-using system (an application validating a certificate/CRL) must reject the certificate/CRL if it encounters a critical extension it does not recognize. A non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.
Regardless of whether these additional PKIXCertPathCheckers are set, a PKIX CertPathValidator or CertPathBuilder must perform all of the required PKIX checks on each certificate
According to the {@link Collection#remove(Object)} method, this method should only remove the first occurrence of the given object, not all occurrences.
This differs from {@link List#removeAll(Collection)} in that cardinality is respected; if list1 contains two occurrences of null and list2 only contains one occurrence, then the returned list will still contain one occurrence.
The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the database. For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column. For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared. Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway. The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only.The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver.
Drivers are not required to support these properties however if the driver supports a client info property that can be described by one of the standard properties, the standard property name should be used.
The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if it implements a method named appendToClassPathForInstrumentation which takes a single parameter of type java.lang.String. The method is not required to have public access.
The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class loader for the purpose of instrumentation. Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected behaviour that is difficult to diagnose (see {@link #appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch}.
If the required access and argument checks succeed and the instantiation will proceed, the constructor's declaring class is initialized if it has not already been initialized.
The driver shall submit a query on the connection or use some other mechanism that positively verifies the connection is still valid when this method is called.The query submitted by the driver to validate the connection shall be executed in the context of the current transaction.
The hashCode method of the returned set returns the sum of the identity hashcodes of the elements in the set, rather than the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the equals method, in order to enforce the general contract of the Object.hashCode method among sets returned by this method.
It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)).
Note that unlike the {@link StrictMath#copySign(float, float) StrictMath.copySign} method, this method does not require NaN sign arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN arguments as negative to allow greater performance.
Note that unlike the {@link StrictMath#copySign(double, double) StrictMath.copySign} method, this method does not require NaN sign arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN arguments as negative to allow greater performance.
Unlike some of the numeric methods of class StrictMath, all implementations of the equivalent functions of class Math are not defined to return the bit-for-bit same results. This relaxation permits better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is not required.
Therefore, most methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise, whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the floating-point approximation.
To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of some of the numeric functions in this package require that they produce the same results as certain published algorithms. These algorithms are available from the well-known network library netlib as the package Freely Distributable Math Library
The description and choices are intialized to null and required is initialized to false.
This method simply informs the group's monitor that the object is inactive. It is up to the concrete subclass of ActivationGroup to fulfill the additional requirement of unexporting the object.
The returned parameters may be the same that were used to initialize this signature, or may contain a combination of default and randomly generated parameter values used by the underlying signature implementation if this signature requires algorithm parameters but was not initialized with any.
Two CodeSource objects are considered equal if their locations are of identical value and if their signer certificate chains are of identical value. It is not required that the certificate chains be in the same order.
The byte array will be in big-endian byte-order: the most significant byte is in the zeroth element. The array will contain the minimum number of bytes required to represent this BigInteger, including at least one sign bit, which is { (ceil((this.bitLength() + 1)/8))}.
If the identity has a public key, the public key in the certificate must be the same, and if the identity does not have a public key, the identity's public key is set to be that specified in the certificate.
The initial owner Principal should be specified as an argument to the constructor of the class implementing this interface.
Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface.
All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four standard constructors:
The special value 0 instructs the packer to copy through the original JAR file directly, with no compression. The JSR 200 standard requires any unpacker to understand this special case as a pass-through of the entire archive.

Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this exception if { fromKey} cannot be compared to keys currently in the map.
The hash code of a list is defined to be the result of the following calculation: int hashCode = 1; Iterator<E> i = list.iterator(); while (i.hasNext()) { E obj = i.next(); hashCode = 31*hashCode + (obj==null ? 0 : obj.hashCode()); } This ensures that list1.equals(list2) implies that list1.hashCode()==list2.hashCode() for any two lists, list1 and list2, as required by the general contract of {@link Object#hashCode}.
Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.
Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to attempt to read as many bytes as possible in the same fashion.
If the protocol of this URL is jar, then the permission granted is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar file.
Tray implementions must not set a layout on the parent composite, or assume a particular layout on the parent.
Note that the default uncaught exception handler should not usually defer to the thread's ThreadGroup object, as that could cause infinite recursion.
all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this class must obey the additional constraints imposed by the Set interface
All general-purpose sorted set implementation classes should provide four standard constructors:
Implementations should use the font of the given drawable to calculate the size of the text to be presented.
The only requirement enforced by this facility is that provider classes must have a zero-argument constructor so that they can be instantiated during loading.
Implementations should seek to avoid creating a new object every time this method is called. See AbstractMap.values() etc. Calling this method on the inverse map should return the original.
The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and map constructor, as per the recommendation in the Map interface specification.
The only requirement enforced by this facility is that provider classes must have a zero-argument constructor so that they can be instantiated during loading.
In order to guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the class { Random}. Java implementations must use all the algorithms shown here for the class { Random}, for the sake of absolute portability of Java code.
Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with them should have two more constructors, one that takes a Throwable (the cause), and one that takes a String (the detail message) and a Throwable (the cause).
Each class name must be for a Handler class which has a default constructor.
The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references: * It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true. * It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true. * It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true. * It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified. * For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.
If no such object exists, the map should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap} method.
All general-purpose Collection implementation classes (which typically implement Collection indirectly through one of its subinterfaces) should provide two standard constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a constructor with a single argument of type Collection, which creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument.
To implement clone(), a subclass must implement the Cloneable interface and make this method public.
All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two standard constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
Implementations should seek to avoid creating a new object every time this method is called. See AbstractMap.values() etc. Calling this method on the inverse map should return the original.
This method must obey the general contract of {@link Object#equals(Object)}.
A single call to { add(int, E)} or { remove(int)} must add no more than one to this field, or the iterators (and list iterators) will throw bogus { ConcurrentModificationExceptions}.
The size of the collection can vary, but it can never exceed a preset maximum number of elements.
In that case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.

This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared mode, and if so to acquire it.
This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared mode, and if so to acquire it.
If no such object exists, the map should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap} method.
Remove any members of the bag that are not in the given collection, respecting cardinality. That is, if the given collection coll contains n copies of a given object and the bag has m > n copies, then delete m - n copies from the bag. In addition, if e is an object in the bag but !coll.contains(e), then remove e and any of its copies.
It must also obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on method entry.
All { Lock} implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in The Java Language Specification, Third Edition (17.4 Memory Model)
A listener must set event.doit to false if it cannot handle the drag operation.
Two possibly null elements e1 and e2 are deeply equal if any of the following conditions hold: e1 and e2 are both arrays of object reference types, and Arrays.deepEquals(e1, e2) would return true e1 and e2 are arrays of the same primitive type, and the appropriate overloading of Arrays.equals(e1, e2) would return true. e1 == e2 e1.equals(e2) would return true. Note that this definition permits null elements at any depth.
This test must be fast and optimistic i.e. it is OK to return true even though there might be no quick fix.
This test must be fast and optimistic i.e. it is OK to return true even though there might be no quick fix.
While Deque implementations are not strictly required to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly encouraged to do so.
If the security property is not set, the provider is assumed to have alternative means for obtaining authentication information.
The view's { iterator} is a weakly consistent iterator that will never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.
The ACL Entries in each ACL observe the following rules: Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL entries are not allowed for any principal. Each entry specifies the set of permissions that are to be granted (if positive) or denied (if negative). If there is no entry for a particular principal, then the principal is considered to have a null (empty) permission set. If there is a positive entry that grants a principal a particular permission, and a negative entry that denies the principal the same permission, the result is as though the permission was never granted or denied. Individual permissions always override permissions of the group(s) to which the individual belongs. That is, individual negative permissions (specific denial of permissions) override the groups' positive permissions. And individual positive permissions override the groups' negative permissions.
Normally this means {@link #setQuickFixable(boolean)} has been called at least once but it can also be hard-coded, e.g. always return true.
Generic list algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list is an instanceof this interface before applying an algorithm that would provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential access list, and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee acceptable performance.

If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
When waiting upon a { Condition}, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur, in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has little practical impact on most application programs as a { Condition} should always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being waited for.
If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
This must be called AFTER all of the child controls have been created and their layouts attached. This method will attach a layout to the given composite. If any new children are created after calling this method, their GridData must be created manually. The algorithm does not recurse into child composites. To generate all the layouts in a widget hierarchy, the method must be called bottom-up for each Composite.
This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the list backwards, or intermixed with calls to next to go back and forth. (Note that alternating calls to next and previous will return the same element repeatedly.)
As of 3.2, AbstractTreeViewer supports multiple equal elements (each with a different parent chain) in the tree. This support requires that clients enable the element map by calling setUseHashLookup(true).
As the ILazyContentProvider does not have API for determining the total item count any changes to the number of items for this object while require a call to #setItemCount on the viewer that uses it.
The recommended usage is to use {@link java.net.URI} to identify resources, then convert it into a {@link java.net.URL} when it is time to access the resource. From that URL, you can either get the {@link java.net.URLConnection} for fine control, or get directly the InputStream.Here is an example:URI uri = new URI(http://java.sun.com/);URL url = uri.toURL();InputStream in = url.openStream();
Since the time when GC would invoke this method is undetermined, it is strongly recommended that applications invoke the close method as soon they have finished accessing this ZipFile.

This signature object is reset to its initial state (the state it was in after a call to one of the initSign methods) and can be reused to generate further signatures with the same private key.
Returns the SWT menu, created as a pop up menu parented by the given control. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs. If the menu must be dynamically created (i.e., each time it is popped up or dropped down), the old menu should be disposed of before replacing it with the new menu.
If the font of the specified control is changed after this PixelConverter is created, then the conversions from this instance will not produce the desired effect.
This method takes the Device that created the Image as an argument, allowing the original Image to be reused if the descriptor is asked for another Image on the same device.
Returns an SWT menu created as a drop down menu parented by the given menu. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs.
Note that all preference nodes must be dispose their resources. The node must dispose the page managed by this node, and any SWT resources allocated by this node (Images, Fonts, etc). However the node itself may be reused.
Previous values of other fields are retained. If this is not desired, call {@link #clear()} first.
When the caller is done with an image obtained from createResource, they must call destroyResource() rather than disposing the Image directly. The result of createResource() can be safely cast to an Image.
Note that depending on the values the human has supplied so far, additional values may become necessary, so it may be necessary to iterate though several calls to the getPropertyInfo method.
There are two cases to be aware of: For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling {@link ServerSocket#setReceiveBufferSize(int)} before the ServerSocket is bound to a local address. For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before connecting the socket to its remote peer.
This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
Painters are informed about changes to the viewer content and state and can take the necessary action in responds to the notification.
If the resource is intended to live for entire lifetime of the resource manager, a subsequent call to {@link #destroy(DeviceResourceDescriptor)} may be omitted and the resource will be cleaned up when the resource manager is disposed. This pattern is useful for short-lived {@link LocalResourceManager}s, but should never be used with the global resource manager since doing so effectively leaks the resource.
Once this method returns successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become permanent.
Adjust the bounds of the popup as necessary prior to opening the dialog.
If fork is set to false, the runnable will run in the UI thread and it is the runnable's responsibility to call Display.readAndDispatch() to ensure UI responsiveness.
Usually, clients instantiate this class and configure it before using it. The configuration must be consistent: This means the used {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControlCreator} must create an information control expecting information in the same format the configured {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.information.IInformationProvider}s use to encode the information they provide.
The preference node assumes (sole) responsibility for disposing of the image; this will happen when the node is disposed.

Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once. The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception. The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString(). Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.The state moves from writable to not writeable once free() or any of the writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString(). Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.

The {@link org.apache.commons.collections.set.ListOrderedSet ListOrderedSet} class provides an alternative approach, by wrapping an existing Set and retaining insertion order in the iterator.
An alternative to this method is to use the better named {@link #keyList()} or {@link #keySet()}.
A Map implementation that is a general purpose alternative to HashMap.This implementation improves on the JDK1.4 HashMap by adding the {@link org.apache.commons.collections.MapIterator MapIterator} functionality and many methods for subclassing.
An alternative to this method is to use {@link #keySet()}.
This method is an alternative to the {@link java.util.Map#putAll(java.util.Map)} method and constructors. It allows you to build a map from an object array of various possible styles.
This map is designed for performance and can outstrip HashMap. It also has good garbage collection characteristics. * Optimised for operation at size 3 or less. * Still works well once size 3 exceeded. * Gets at size 3 or less are about 0-10% faster than HashMap, * Puts at size 3 or less are over 4 times faster than HashMap. * Performance 5% slower than HashMap once size 3 exceeded once.
The simplest approach is to wrap this map using {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap(Map)}.

This list implementation utilises a tree structure internally to ensure that all insertions and removals are O(log n). This provides much faster performance than both an ArrayList and a LinkedList where elements are inserted and removed repeatedly from anywhere in the list.
ArrayList is a good general purpose list implementation. It is faster than TreeList for most operations except inserting and removing in the middle of the list. ArrayList also uses less memory as TreeList uses one object per entry.
If you know that you have an object array, the {@link org.apache.commons.collections.iterators.ObjectArrayIterator ObjectArrayIterator} class is a better choice, as it will perform better.
If you know that you have an object array, the {@link ObjectArrayListIterator} class is a better choice, as it will perform better.
Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than reading out the contents of each Iterator into a List and creating a new Iterator.
Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than using nested for loops to extract a list.
This iterator is a special version designed for maps. It can be more efficient to use this rather than an entry set iterator where the option is available, and it is certainly more convenient.
A map iterator is an efficient way of iterating over maps. There is no need to access the entry set or use Map Entry objects.

Because a Locale object is just an identifier for a region, no validity check is performed when you construct a Locale. If you want to see whether particular resources are available for the Locale you construct, you must query those resources.
The following can be used to provide synchronized access to your BoundedFifoBuffer: Buffer fifo = BufferUtils.synchronizedBuffer(new BoundedFifoBuffer());
The following can be used to provide synchronized access to your CircularFifoBuffer: Buffer fifo = BufferUtils.synchronizedBuffer(new CircularFifoBuffer());
Note that this method can be used to circumvent the map's value type at runtime.
Note that IdentityMap and ReferenceIdentityMap are unsuitable for use as the key comparison would work on the whole MultiKey, not the elements within.
Use {@link org.apache.commons.collections.BufferUtils#synchronizedBuffer(Buffer)} or {@link org.apache.commons.collections.buffer.SynchronizedBuffer#decorate(Buffer)} to provide synchronized access to a PriorityBuffer:
. You can use {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap} to provide synchronized access to a ReferenceIdentityMap.

In previous versions of this class, it was mandatory to close all cursor objects to avoid memory leaks. It is no longer necessary to call this close method; an instance of this class can now be treated exactly like a normal iterator.
If you subclass AbstractLinkedMap but not LinkEntry then you will not be able to access the protected fields. The entryXxx() methods on AbstractLinkedMap exist to provide the necessary access.
If you subclass AbstractHashedMap but not HashEntry then you will not be able to access the protected fields. The entryXxx() methods on AbstractHashedMap exist to provide the necessary access.
In addition, this implementation allows the type of collection used for the values to be controlled. By default, an ArrayList is used, however a Class to instantiate may be specified, or a factory that returns a Collection instance.
Although this can be used to reset iteration, the {@link #reset()} method is a more effective choice.
If the last value for a key is removed, implementations typically return null from a subsequant get(Object), however they may choose to return an empty collection.
Implementations typically return null if no values have been mapped to the key, however the implementation may choose to return an empty collection.
@return the Collection of values, implementations should return null for no mapping, but may return an empty collection
Implementations typically return null from a subsequant get(Object), however they may choose to return an empty collection.
@return the Collection of values removed, implementations should return null for no mapping found, but may return an empty collection
For random access data (such as an array), AbstractList should be used in preference to this class.
Like most collection implementations, EnumSet is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet} method.

Instances of StringBuilder are not safe for use by multiple threads. If such synchronization is required then it is recommended that {@link java.lang.StringBuffer} be used.
Unless a new instance is required, the static factory {@link #valueOf(boolean)} is generally a better choice.
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the interface SQLData), the JDBC driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write it to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, NClob, Struct, java.net.URL, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type.

Note that the current contents of the MemoryHandler buffer are not written out. That requires a push.
Like the {@link #matches matches} method, this method always starts at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not require that the entire region be matched.
Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.
If a lookup of the name service is required, call {@link #getCanonicalHostName() getCanonicalHostName}.
Standard implementations of common closures are provided by {@link ClosureUtils}. These include method invokation and for/while loops.
Standard implementations of common predicates are provided by {@link PredicateUtils}. These include true, false, instanceof, equals, and, or, not, method invokation and null testing.

If no such object exists, the list should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList} method.
When threads must repeatedly count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
Events are not generated when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.
If these requirements cannot be met, consider instead subclassing {@link AbstractCollection}.
If you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even if users forget to call {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#shutdown}, then you must arrange that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or setting {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.
If {@link ICompletionProposalExtension5} is implemented, this method should not be called any longer.
In case the client does not explicitly initialize the AlgorithmParameterGenerator (via a call to an engineInit method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.

When a very large ASCII value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a java.io.InputStream.
This selection should be used instead of null.
Clients should handle labelProviderChangedEvents for the given element to get the complete decoration.
Add operations require the use of a pluggable strategy. If no strategy is provided then add is unsupported.
Add and remove operations require the use of a pluggable strategy. If no strategy is provided then add and remove are unsupported.
These formatting strategies are required to handle the position updating of the document. To facilitate the work with these text edit based formatting strategies, a default implementation called ContextBasedFormattingStrategy is provided.
This method should no longer be used for actions in the Eclipse workbench. IWorkbenchCommandSupport and IWorkbenchContextSupport provide all the functionality required for key bindings.

Specifying which properties are affected may allow the viewer to optimize the update. For example, if the label provider is not affected by changes to any of these properties, an update may not actually be required.
It is recommended that clients do not implement this interface but instead use the standard implementation of this interface, {@link TreeSelection}.
The default is false for backwards compatibility, but the recommended practice is to specify true, and specify the desired width for the content of the column, rather than adding a fudge factor to the specified width.
It is recommended to use setComparator() instead.
It is recommended to use getComparator() instead.
It is recommended that getFontDataArray is used instead.
This is not recommended and is included for backwards compatability. It is recommended to use the default font provided by SWT (that is, do not set the font).
@deprecated as this method only checks or unchecks visible items is is recommended that {@link #setSubtreeChecked(Object, boolean)} is used instead.
If the caller adds its own columns, uses Table.setHeadersVisible(true), or needs to handle dynamic resizing of the table, it is recommended to create the Table itself, specifying the SWT.CHECK style bit (along with any other style bits needed), and use new CheckboxTableViewer(Table) rather than this constructor.
This method is provided for backwards compatibility. It is recommended that getDefaultFontDataArray is used instead.
@deprecated This type of security checking is not recommended. It is recommended that the checkPermission call be used instead.

@deprecated This method does not automatically escape characters that are illegal in URLs. It is recommended that new code convert an abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the {@link #toURI() toURI} method, and then converting the URI into a URL via the {@link java.net.URI#toURL() URI.toURL} method.
StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.
Overloadings of this method exist to initialize an enum set with one through five elements. A sixth overloading is provided that uses the varargs feature. This overloading may be used to create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.

Subclasses of ClassLoader are encouraged to override {@link #findClass(String)}, rather than this method.
Typically you shouldn't use DateFormatSymbols directly. Rather, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with the DateFormat class's factory methods: getTimeInstance, getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance.

This {@literal static factory method} is provided in preference to a ({ long}, { int}) constructor because it allows for reuse of frequently used { BigDecimal} values.
The three forms of { park} each also support a { blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a { blocker} within a lock implementation is { this}.
SimpleDateFormat allows you to start by choosing any user-defined patterns for date-time formatting. However, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with either getTimeInstance, getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance in DateFormat.

You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of ResourceBundles. For example, you could have a set of bundles for exception messages, ExceptionResources (ExceptionResources_fr, ExceptionResources_de, ...), and one for widgets, WidgetResource (WidgetResources_fr, WidgetResources_de, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.
When possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate estimate of how much new data can actually be written than {@link #getFreeSpace}.

CollationKeys provide better performance than Collator.compare when Strings are involved in multiple comparisons.
Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization, it is generally better to use the {@link #setFormatByArgumentIndex setFormatByArgumentIndex} method, which accesses format elements based on the argument index they specify.
For comparing Strings exactly once, the compare method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of Strings however, it is generally necessary to compare each String multiple times. In this case, CollationKeys provide better performance.
Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization, it is generally better to use the {@link #setFormatsByArgumentIndex setFormatsByArgumentIndex} method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the order of elements in the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods.

It should be set once either in the constructor or using this method.
If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set: Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set.

If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map: Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));
If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally.

Note that the static convenience method getImage is also provided on this class.
Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous addition of multiple elements.
If only the given element needs updating, it is more efficient to use the update methods.
If the old behavior is desired by subclasses, get the returned composite's layout data and set grabExcessVerticalSpace to true.
The default CertPathBuilder type can be changed by setting the value of the certpathbuilder.type security property (in the Java security properties file) to the desired type.
Once a remote object is registered (bound) with the RMI registry on the local host, callers on a remote (or local) host can lookup the remote object by name, obtain its reference, and then invoke remote methods on the object. A registry may be shared by all servers running on a host or an individual server process may create and use its own registry if desired (see java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry.createRegistry method for details).
The default CertPathValidator type can be changed by setting the value of the certpathvalidator.type security property (in the Java security properties file) to the desired type.

By default it looks in sun.net.www.content, but users can define a vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes to search through in addition by defining the java.content.handler.pkgs property.
If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive caching.
This does not handle structural changes (e.g. addition or removal of elements), and does not update any other related elements (e.g. child elements). To handle structural changes, use the refresh methods instead.
These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most concurrency control applications.
This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
Because databases may use an optimized representation for the XML, accessing the value through getSource() and setResult() can lead to improved processing performance without serializing to a stream representation and parsing the XML.

This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access: Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));
For a one time comparison, this method has the best performance. If a given String will be involved in multiple comparisons, CollationKey.compareTo has the best performance.
Note that if both the integer quotient and remainder are needed, this method is faster than using the { divideToIntegralValue} and { remainder} methods separately because the division need only be carried out once.
Note that there is a significant difference between writing a String into the stream as primitive data or as an Object.

You must manually synchronize on the returned buffer's iterator to avoid non-deterministic behavior:
Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from accessing a resource.
Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this interface.
Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior.
An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.
In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual machine and should therefore be coded defensively. They should, in particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar as possible. They should also not rely blindly upon services that may have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in the process of shutting down. Attempts to use other thread-based services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to deadlocks.

The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.

@param map the map to transform, must not be null, typically empty
Implementations of these methods must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and not block.
When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when necessary.
Due to the multi-threaded nature of class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively to expect this situation.
When threads must repeatedly count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
A ResourceBundle.Control instance must be thread-safe if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads.
This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.
The absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with { synchronized} methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:
All { Lock} implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in The Java Language Specification, Third Edition (17.4 Memory Model)
@param sortOrder new sort order. The comparator must be able to support being used in a background thread.
This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result. Failure to do this may result in an {@link SWTException} being thrown.
Likewise any application that updates an IPreferenceStore from a Thread other than the UI Thread should be aware of any listeners that require an update in the UI Thread.
It is recommended practice to always immediately follow a call to { lock} with a { try} block, most typically in a before/after construction
ttempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
Note that in context based mode the content formatter is fully reentrant, but not thread-safe.
This method may be called on a non-UI thread.
The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an expensive operation. The programmer should be aware that this may be the case.
This may be executed on any thread.
Thread-safe implementation. Can be called from any thread.
This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use { Condition} instances in this way, except perhaps within their own implementation.
Formats are generally not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
Attempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result will be inaccurate.
If this write lock is not held when any {@link Condition} method is called then an {@link IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown. (Read locks are held independently of write locks, so are not checked or affected. However it is essentially always an error to invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread has also acquired read locks, since other threads that could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write lock.)
Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a { ConcurrentMap} as a key or value happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that object from the { ConcurrentMap} in another thread.
Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection.
Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not spin in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with fast-path checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended} and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended.
This method is fully reentrant, but not thread-safe.
If the preferences or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a fuzzy snapshot of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

The model is allowed to send back notifications to its listeners in any thread, and the listeners must not assume that the notifications will arrive in the UI thread.
DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.
Note that if your application creates its own custom activation group, a security manager must be set for that group
If your application needs to set a different security manager, you must ensure that the policy file specified by the group's ActivationGroupDesc grants the group the necessary permissions to set a new security manager
The associated method must be public and its parameters return value, and exceptions must follow the rules defined in JAX-RPC 1.1, section
The JSR-181 tool must provide feedback if the service implementation bean is inconsistent with the portType and bindings declared in this WSDL.
Mailcap files must conform to the mailcap file specification
The circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that { Lock} implementation.
Typically, an exception will be thrown (such as {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}) and the implementation must document that fact.
An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods
If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the implementation must document those semantics.
The exact operation of the {@link Condition} instance depends on the { Lock} implementation and must be documented by that implementation.

Clients may call this method in order to trigger the menu via keystrokes or other gestures
For indeterminate progress, we don't have to know the total amount of work in advance and no worked method needs to be called.
Clients may also call this method to persist the bounds at times other than closing the dialog.
This can be called even after the dialog is closed.
An application should catch instances of this class only if it must clean up after being terminated asynchronously.
The instanceof operator should be used to determine the specific kind of object returned.
Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality. For example: URL url = new URL(jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/); JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection(); Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest();
@return the object fetched. The instanceof operator should be used to determine the specific kind of object returned.
If your application requires specific properties to be set when objects are activated in the group, the application should create a special Properties object containing these properties, then create an ActivationGroupDesc with the Properties object, and use ActivationGroup.createGroup before creating any ActivationDescs (before the default ActivationGroupDesc is created).
This field should be documented with a serialField tag.
@serialData Overriding methods should use this tag to describe the data layout of this Externalizable object.
A piped input stream should be connected to a piped output stream; the piped input stream then provides whatever data bytes are written to the piped output stream.
Security note: If an application needs to read a password or other secure data, it should use {@link #readPassword()} or {@link #readPassword(String, Object...)} and manually zero the returned character array after processing to minimize the lifetime of sensitive data in memory.
Classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it is read from the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature. ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;
Serializable classes that need to designate an alternative object to be used when writing an object to the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature: ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;
An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.
The Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to receive formatted output from a {@link java.util.Formatter}.
An application should not normally try to catch ThreadDeath unless it must do some extraordinary cleanup operation (note that the throwing of ThreadDeath causes finally clauses of try statements to be executed before the thread officially dies). If a catch clause catches a ThreadDeath object, it is important to rethrow the object so that the thread actually dies.
To create a custom mapping, a programmer must do two things: * create a class that implements the {@link SQLData} interface for the UDT to be custom mapped. * make an entry in a type map that contains o the fully-qualified SQL type name of the UDT o the Class object for the class implementing SQLData
Additional columns beyond the columns defined to be returned by the ResultSet object for a given method can be defined by the JDBC driver vendor and must be accessed by their column label.
If auto-commit mode has been disabled, the method commit must be called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
First, if the strings to be collated contain combining sequences that may not be in canonical order, you should set the collator to CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION or FULL_DECOMPOSITION to enable sorting of combining sequences.
This constructor should only be used for serialization.
This constructor is used for serialization only and should not be used by subclasses.
Each class that implements PrivilegedExceptionAction should document what (if anything) this value represents.
Each class that implements PrivilegedAction should document what (if anything) this value represents.
Each subclass should state the precise behavior of this method so that users and developers know what to expect.
Note that digest objects can compute only one digest (see {@link MessageDigest}), so that in order to compute intermediate digests, a caller should retain a handle onto the digest object, and clone it for each digest to be computed, leaving the orginal digest untouched.
No check is made that the object is immutable. In general, only immutable objects should use the constant factory.

Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection.
A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its key factory
Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x).
Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(String parameterName, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(String parameterName, Object x).
To be portable, however, applications should always provide these values for user-named and REF parameters.
In this case, the caller can still decide to show the window, but the window should include some sort of visual warning.
This is important because classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.
Compiler vendors should document the warning names they support in conjunction with this annotation type.
If it is critical to obtain every active thread in this thread group, the caller should verify that the returned int value is strictly less than the length of list.
f it is critical to obtain every active subgroup in this thread group, the caller should verify that the returned int value is strictly less than the length of list.

As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
An implementation should document when this is the case.
Any restrictions and the exception type must be documented by that { Lock} implementation.

If a new Boolean instance is not required, this method should generally be used in preference to the constructor {@link #Boolean(boolean)}, as this method is likely to yield significantly better space and time performance.
Note that the default implementation is not very efficient and should be overridden if this class is implemented.
While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. In other words, waits should always occur in loops, like this one: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(timeout); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(timeout, nanos); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
For some memory pools, for example, when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine the current memory usage. An implementation should document when this is the case.
Environment variables should be used when a global effect is desired, or when an external system interface requires an environment variable (such as PATH).
Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
An application remotely accesses the platform MXBeans using proxy should prepare to catch IOException as if accessing with the MBeanServerConnector interface.
When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans for a running virtual machine whose version is different than the version on which the application is running, it should prepare to catch {@link java.io.InvalidObjectException InvalidObjectException} which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in the client application.
The specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is capable of throwing such exceptions.
The StringBuilder class should generally be used in preference to this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as it performs no synchronization.
Implementers should document whether the runnable is run synchronously (blocking) or asynchronously (non-blocking), or if no assumption can be made about the blocking behaviour.
Implementers should ignore the text returned by {@link IInformationProvider#getInformation(ITextViewer, IRegion)}.
This method may be called frequently, so implementors should ensure it returns quickly, e.g. by caching the returned creator.
This map is designed for performance and can outstrip HashMap. It also has good garbage collection characteristics. * Optimised for operation at size 3 or less. * Still works well once size 3 exceeded. * Gets at size 3 or less are about 0-10% faster than HashMap, * Puts at size 3 or less are over 4 times faster than HashMap. * Performance 5% slower than HashMap once size 3 exceeded once.
This list implementation utilises a tree structure internally to ensure that all insertions and removals are O(log n). This provides much faster performance than both an ArrayList and a LinkedList where elements are inserted and removed repeatedly from anywhere in the list.
ArrayList is a good general purpose list implementation. It is faster than TreeList for most operations except inserting and removing in the middle of the list. ArrayList also uses less memory as TreeList uses one object per entry.
Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than reading out the contents of each Iterator into a List and creating a new Iterator.
Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than using nested for loops to extract a list.

List classes should clearly specify in their documentation any restrictions on what elements may be added.
An implementation should document when this is the case.
In order both to sign and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to normalize it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements, and finally repack the signed JAR.
In general SEVERE messages should describe events that are of considerable importance and which will prevent normal program execution. They should be reasonably intelligible to end users and to system administrators.
he class remained source and test compatible, so if you can recompile all your classes and dependencies everything is OK.
Note that in this case, traversal to find that element takes linear time.
If they are not then they must not be changed after adding to the MultiKey.
If they are not then they must not be changed after adding to the MultiKey.
Implementation note: This method requires a lot of time and a ton of stack space. Essentially a recursive algorithm is used to enter each bucket's monitor. If you have twenty thousand buckets in your map, then the recursive method will be invoked twenty thousand times. You have been warned.
Although this can be used to reset iteration, the {@link #reset()} method is a more effective choice.

Finally, unlike {@link java.util.HashMap}-style implementations, this class never rehashes the map. The number of buckets is fixed at construction time and never altered. Performance may degrade if you do not allocate enough buckets upfront.
he number of buckets is inversely proportional to the chances for thread contention. The fewer buckets, the more chances for thread contention. The more buckets the fewer chances for thread contention.
The {@link #atomic(Runnable)} method is provided to allow atomic iterations and bulk operations; however, overuse of {@link #atomic(Runnable) atomic} will basically result in a map that's slower than an ordinary synchronized {@link java.util.HashMap}.
In general WARNING messages should describe events that will be of interest to end users or system managers, or which indicate potential problems.
So the INFO level should only be used for reasonably significant messages that will make sense to end users and system admins.
In general the FINE level should be used for information that will be broadly interesting to developers who do not have a specialized interest in the specific subsystem.
Both packing steps should use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also need to be set to -1, to prevent accidental variation of segment boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.
Valuable data should not be stored at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.
The add methods are affected by this class. Thus objects must be removed or searched for using their transformed form. For example, if the transformation converts Strings to Integers, you must use the Integer form to remove objects.

Therefore, if a logging Handler wants to pass off a LogRecord to another thread, or to transmit it over RMI, and if it wishes to subsequently obtain method name or class name information it should call one of getSourceClassName or getSourceMethodName to force the values to be filled in.
Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.
To be portable, however, applications should always provide these values for user-defined and REF parameters.
Compilers must ignore any warning names they do not recognize.
JDBC 4.0 Drivers must include the file META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver.
It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be small and standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
For some memory pools, this method may be an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine the estimate.
If a method is annotated with this annotation type but does not override a superclass method, compilers are required to generate an error message.
There is no requirement that a process represented by a Process object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect to the Java process that owns the Process object.
Note that the amount of memory required to hold an object of any given type may be implementation-dependent.
A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught.
A driver may only report true here if it passes the JDBC compliance tests; otherwise it is required to return false.JDBC compliance requires full support for the JDBC API and full support for SQL 92 Entry Level. It is expected that JDBC compliant drivers will be available for all the major commercial databases.
Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is not a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these sets, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements.

For example, some List implementations provide asymptotically linear access times if they get huge, but constant access times in practice. Such a List implementation should generally implement this interface.
As a rule, the equals method should be used by implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
Beware that, unlike in most collections, the { size} method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements.
Sets a new selection for this viewer and optionally makes it visible. The TableViewer implementation of this method is inefficient for the ILazyContentProvider as lookup is done by indices rather than elements and may require population of the entire table in worse case.Use Table#setSelection(int[] indices) and Table#showSelection() if you wish to set selection more efficiently when using a ILazyContentProvider.
It is strongly recommended that a cancel option be provided, so that the user has the option of making the decision at a later point in time.
IDialogConstants is the interface for common dialog strings and ids used throughout JFace. It is recommended that you use these labels and ids whereever for consistency with the JFace dialogs.
It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used to register other application managed beans besides the platform MXBeans.

Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to document their implementation's behavior with respect to the stackSize parameter.
Code generators are encouraged to use platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions, where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of Math methods. Such higher-performance implementations still must conform to the specification for Math.
It is a compile-time error for a single ElementType constant to appear more than once in a Target annotation.
Caching the state is important to improve overall performance as calling {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.quickassist.IQuickAssistAssistant#canFix(Annotation)} can be expensive.
Disables randomization and enables additional runtime error checking. Severely degrades performance if set to true. Intended for use in test suites only.
Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can help reduce the backlog of incoming data.
Specifying this flag may impose a performance penalty.
Note: The object returned from this method may be an instance of an implementation-specific class. The RemoteObject class ensures serialization portability of its instances' remote references through the behavior of its custom writeObject and readObject methods. An instance of RemoteRef should not be serialized outside of its RemoteObject wrapper instance or the result may be unportable.
