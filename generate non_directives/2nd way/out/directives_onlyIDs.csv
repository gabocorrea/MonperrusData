11347,Therefore an RMI application should use the SecurityManager class or another application-specific SecurityManager implementation instead of this class.
11744,An application should not normally try to catch ThreadDeath unless it must do some extraordinary cleanup operation (note that the throwing of ThreadDeath causes finally clauses of try statements to be executed before the thread officially dies). If a catch clause catches a ThreadDeath object, it is important to rethrow the object so that the thread actually dies.
19898,Granting AllPermission should be done with extreme care, as it implies all other permissions. Thus, it grants code the ability to run with security disabled. Extreme caution should be taken before granting such a permission to code. This permission should be used only during testing, or in extremely rare cases where an application or applet is completely trusted and adding the necessary permissions to the policy is prohibitively cumbersome.

10797,In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to save and restore the state of the non-serializable class.
14358,The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: It must write each of the attributes of the SQL type to the given output stream. This is done by calling a method of the output stream to write each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. Specifically, it must call the appropriate SQLOutput writer method(s) (writeInt, writeString, and so on) to do the following: for a Distinct Type, write its single data element; for a Structured Type, write a value for each attribute of the SQL type.

-1,Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the PermissionCollection should call the newPermissionCollection method on the permission's class to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection.
6557,Note that it is the responsibility of the implementor to dispose of SWT menus it creates.
14219,At a minimum, the recovery operation must include closing the current connection and getting a new connection.
234,Implementors are responsible for ensuring that the created control can be accessed via getControl
17640,When processing logging output, if a Handler encounters problems then rather than throwing an Exception back to the issuer of the logging call (who is unlikely to be interested) the Handler should call its associated ErrorManager.
-1,Calls to the getAttribute and setAttribute methods must map to the get and put methods of the Bindings for the specified scope.
4547,Implementation of this method must finish their computation by setting the computation results using setInformation.
6336,Note: As of 3.4, you should only call this method if you want to override the {@link JFacePreferences#CONTENT_ASSIST_FOREGROUND_COLOR}.
-1,Subclasses may call the noDefaultAndApplyButton framework method before the page's control has been created to suppress the standard Apply and Defaults buttons.
19294,If the scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed; in this case, the specified rounding mode is applied to the division.

-1,The general contract for the Object.equals method states that equals must be symmetric (in other words, a.equals(b) if and only if b.equals(a)).
18661,In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
15423,SocketPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any orde
15382,They therefore must either be parsed as such or treated as an error.
19295,If the scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed
19890,BasicPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted in any order,
15429,This option must be specified in the constructor.
12584,The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive
-1,Finally, the implementor must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies that sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z.
14102,All execution methods in the Statement interface implicitly close a statment's current ResultSet object if an open one exists.
13127,Instances of classes that implement this interface must implement an equals() method that equates any two instances that share the same generic type declaration and have equal type parameters.
-1,A valid reduction polynomial is either a trinomial (X^m + X^k + 1 with m > k >= 1) or a pentanomial (X^m + X^k3 + X^k2 + X^k1 + 1 with m > k3 > k2 > k1 >= 1), so ks should have length 1 or 3.
-1,Note: By definition, the execution of positioned updates and deletes must be done by a different Statement object than the one that generated the ResultSet object being used for positioning.
13112,Creating a type variable must not cause the creation of its bounds. Repeated creation of a type variable has no effect.
-1,However, all instances representing a type variable must be equal() to each other.
-1,When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.
10861,When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.
7606,This map enforces the restriction that there is a 1:1 relation between keys and values, meaning that multiple keys cannot map to the same value. This is required so that inverting the map results in a map without duplicate keys.
10735,The general contract of flush is that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously written have been buffered by the implementation of the output stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their intended destination.
-1,The redefinition must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
-1,A JDBC driver must apply this limit to the execute, executeQuery and executeUpdate methods.
16255,The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly, that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements (as defined above).
6994,Implementations are encouraged to make regular use of Assert.isNotNull to ensure that null parameters are detected as early as possible.
15355,Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved into the same IP addresses; else if either host name can't be resolved, the host names must be equal without regard to case; or both host names equal to null.
15405,For two URIs to be considered equal requires that either both are opaque or both are hierarchical. Their schemes must either both be undefined or else be equal without regard to case. Their fragments must either both be undefined or else be equal. For two opaque URIs to be considered equal, their scheme-specific parts must be equal. For two hierarchical URIs to be considered equal, their paths must be equal and their queries must either both be undefined or else be equal. Their authorities must either both be undefined, or both be registry-based, or both be server-based. If their authorities are defined and are registry-based, then they must be equal. If their authorities are defined and are server-based, then their hosts must be equal without regard to case, their port numbers must be equal, and their user-information components must be equal.
-1,The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: It must write each of the attributes of the SQL type to the given output stream. This is done by calling a method of the output stream to write each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. Specifically, it must call the appropriate SQLOutput writer method(s) (writeInt, writeString, and so on) to do the following: for a Distinct Type, write its single data element; for a Structured Type, write a value for each attribute of the SQL type.
10498,Classes that require special handling during the serialization and deserialization process must implement special methods with these exact signatures
-1,A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long
-1,The implementor must ensure sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x)) for all x and y. (This implies that x.compareTo(y) must throw an exception iff y.compareTo(x) throws an exception.) The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: (x.compareTo(y)>0 && y.compareTo(z)>0) implies x.compareTo(z)>0. Finally, the implementor must ensure that x.compareTo(y)==0 implies that sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z)), for all z.
-1,If markpos is not -1, then all bytes from positions buf[markpos] through buf[pos-1] must remain in the buffer array
-1,. Should only succeed once per remote call.
15755,Calling disconnect() should not imply that this HttpURLConnection instance can be reused for other requests.
-1,The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: * It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL type from the given input stream. This is done by calling a method of the input stream to read each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. * The method readSQL then assigns the data to appropriate fields or elements (of this or other objects). Specifically, it must call the appropriate reader method (SQLInput.readString, SQLInput.readBigDecimal, and so on) method(s) to do the following: for a distinct type, read its single data element; for a structured type, read a value for each attribute of the SQL type.
-1,A PKIXCertPathChecker must support reverse checking and may support forward checking.
-1,The general contract of hashCode is: * Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. * If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. * It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.
10962,Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.
-1,# codesource must not be null. # If this object's certificates are not null, then all of this object's certificates must be present in codesource's certificates. # If this object's location (getLocation()) is not null, then the following checks are made against this object's location and codesource's: 1. codesource's location must not be null. 2. If this object's location equals codesource's location, then return true. 3. This object's protocol (getLocation().getProtocol()) must be equal to codesource's protocol. 4. If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null, then the SocketPermission constructed with this object's host must imply the SocketPermission constructed with codesource's host. 5. If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal codesource's port. 6. If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal codesource's file, then the following checks are made: If this object's file ends with /-, then codesource's file must start with this object's file (exclusive the trailing -). If this object's file ends with a /*, then codesource's file must start with this object's file and must not have any further / separators. If this object's file doesn't end with a /, then codesource's file must match this object's file with a '/' appended. 7. If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is not null, it must equal codesource's reference.
13661,Format subclasses that are aware of Field should give precedence to attribute and ignore fieldID if attribute is not null.
14707,When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a user can load and register a driver by calling Class.forName(foo.bah.Driver)
13123,The reliability of this method is important for the ability to use it to make security decisions, so its implementation should not just test if the class in question extends Proxy.
19775,A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
7325,@param input the object to be transformed, should be left unchanged
7610,Implementations should seek to avoid creating a new object every time this method is called.
13602,When you are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are treated as equivalent. In addition, you must handle characters with more than one accent.
-1,@param classfileBuffer the input byte buffer in class file format - must not be modified
-1,A PKIXCertPathChecker implementation must support reverse checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the reverse direction) and may support forward checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the forward direction).
13701,For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the suffixes must be distinct for DecimalFormat.parse() to be able to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then DecimalFormat will behave as if no negative subpattern was specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.
13299,The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.
20156,A certificate/CRL-using system (an application validating a certificate/CRL) must reject the certificate/CRL if it encounters a critical extension it does not recognize. A non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.
20333,Regardless of whether these additional PKIXCertPathCheckers are set, a PKIX CertPathValidator or CertPathBuilder must perform all of the required PKIX checks on each certificate
-1,According to the {@link Collection#remove(Object)} method, this method should only remove the first occurrence of the given object, not all occurrences.
-1,This differs from {@link List#removeAll(Collection)} in that cardinality is respected; if list1 contains two occurrences of null and list2 only contains one occurrence, then the returned list will still contain one occurrence.
-1,The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the database. For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column. For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared. Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway. The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only.The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver.

20567,The ACL Entries in each ACL observe the following rules: Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL entries are not allowed for any principal. Each entry specifies the set of permissions that are to be granted (if positive) or denied (if negative). If there is no entry for a particular principal, then the principal is considered to have a null (empty) permission set. If there is a positive entry that grants a principal a particular permission, and a negative entry that denies the principal the same permission, the result is as though the permission was never granted or denied. Individual permissions always override permissions of the group(s) to which the individual belongs. That is, individual negative permissions (specific denial of permissions) override the groups' positive permissions. And individual positive permissions override the groups' negative permissions.

18815,If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
-1,When waiting upon a { Condition}, a spurious wakeup is permitted to occur, in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has little practical impact on most application programs as a { Condition} should always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being waited for.
18816,If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
680,This must be called AFTER all of the child controls have been created and their layouts attached. This method will attach a layout to the given composite.

To generate all the layouts in a widget hierarchy, the method must be called bottom-up for each Composite.
16600,This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the list backwards, or intermixed with calls to next to go back and forth. (Note that alternating calls to next and previous will return the same element repeatedly.)
3279,As of 3.2, AbstractTreeViewer supports multiple equal elements (each with a different parent chain) in the tree. This support requires that clients enable the element map by calling setUseHashLookup(true).

69,The recommended usage is to use {@link java.net.URI} to identify resources, then convert it into a {@link java.net.URL} when it is time to access the resource. From that URL, you can either get the {@link java.net.URLConnection} for fine control, or get directly the InputStream.Here is an example:URI uri = new URI(http://java.sun.com/);URL url = uri.toURL();InputStream in = url.openStream();
18994,Since the time when GC would invoke this method is undetermined, it is strongly recommended that applications invoke the close method as soon they have finished accessing this ZipFile.
14977,It is strongly recommended that an application explicitly commits or rolls back an active transaction prior to calling the close method.
3327,Note that the default implementation of this method does not call setRedraw.

6559,Returns the SWT menu, created as a pop up menu parented by the given control. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs. If the menu must be dynamically created (i.e., each time it is popped up or dropped down), the old menu should be disposed of before replacing it with the new menu.
655,If the font of the specified control is changed after this PixelConverter is created, then the conversions from this instance will not produce the desired effect.
713,This method takes the Device that created the Image as an argument, allowing the original Image to be reused if the descriptor is asked for another Image on the same device.
6560,Returns an SWT menu created as a drop down menu parented by the given menu. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs.
1379,Note that all preference nodes must be dispose their resources. The node must dispose the page managed by this node, and any SWT resources allocated by this node (Images, Fonts, etc). However the node itself may be reused.
17088,Previous values of other fields are retained. If this is not desired, call {@link #clear()} first.
-1,When the caller is done with an image obtained from createResource, they must call destroyResource() rather than disposing the Image directly. The result of createResource() can be safely cast to an Image.
-1,Note that depending on the values the human has supplied so far, additional values may become necessary, so it may be necessary to iterate though several calls to the getPropertyInfo method.
-1,There are two cases to be aware of: For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling {@link ServerSocket#setReceiveBufferSize(int)} before the ServerSocket is bound to a local address. For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before connecting the socket to its remote peer.
909,This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
4434,Painters are informed about changes to the viewer content and state and can take the necessary action in responds to the notification.
-1,If the resource is intended to live for entire lifetime of the resource manager, a subsequent call to {@link #destroy(DeviceResourceDescriptor)} may be omitted and the resource will be cleaned up when the resource manager is disposed. This pattern is useful for short-lived {@link LocalResourceManager}s, but should never be used with the global resource manager since doing so effectively leaks the resource.
17687,Once this method returns successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become permanent.
-1,Adjust the bounds of the popup as necessary prior to opening the dialog.
-1,If fork is set to false, the runnable will run in the UI thread and it is the runnable's responsibility to call Display.readAndDispatch() to ensure UI responsiveness.
5283,Usually, clients instantiate this class and configure it before using it. The configuration must be consistent: This means the used {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControlCreator} must create an information control expecting information in the same format the configured {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.information.IInformationProvider}s use to encode the information they provide.
-1,The preference node assumes (sole) responsibility for disposing of the image; this will happen when the node is disposed.

11747,In other words, if this method were to be called twice in succession, the second call would return false (unless the current thread were interrupted again, after the first call had cleared its interrupted status and before the second call had examined it).
-1,If this rules relies on a text pattern comprising a opening and a closing character sequence this method can also be called when the scanner is positioned already between the opening and the closing sequence. In this case, resume must be set to true.
15033,The object is invalid once the free method is called.
10454,Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(), mark(), or reset() invocations will throw an IOException

15508,Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound). A new socket needs to be created.
10415,Once the stream has been closed, further write() or flush() invocations will cause an IOException to be thrown.
-1,Once this method is called, the behavior of the Deflater object is undefined.
7245,lients should typically call this method once, create a color from the RGB provided, and dispose of the color when finished using it.

4958,Note: This method must be called at most once per reconcile step.
1673,Once the client is done with a wizard node, its disposemethod must be called to free up the wizard; once disposes, the node should no longer be used.
5996,Unlike {@link ISourceViewer#configure(SourceViewerConfiguration)} this method can be called more than once without interleaving calls to {@link ISourceViewer#configure(SourceViewerConfiguration)}.
6671,It should be set when the action is created. It should not be modified once the action is part of an action contribution item.

-1,For random access data (such as an array), AbstractList should be used in preference to this class.
-1,Like most collection implementations, EnumSet is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet} method.
-1,If multiple threads access a tree set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedSet Collections.synchronizedSortedSet} method.

-1,This {@literal static factory method} is provided in preference to a ({ long}, { int}) constructor because it allows for reuse of frequently used { BigDecimal} values.
-1,The three forms of { park} each also support a { blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a { blocker} within a lock implementation is { this}.

-1,If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be wrapped using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set: Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
-1,If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set.

-1,In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
12170,Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual machine and should therefore be coded defensively. They should, in particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar as possible. They should also not rely blindly upon services that may have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in the process of shutting down. Attempts to use other thread-based services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to deadlocks.

-1,@param map the map to transform, must not be null, typically empty
-1,Implementations of these methods must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and not block.
-1,When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when necessary.
13297,Due to the multi-threaded nature of class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively to expect this situation.
-1,When threads must repeatedly count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
-1,A ResourceBundle.Control instance must be thread-safe if it's simultaneously used by multiple threads.
-1,This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.
-1,The absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with { synchronized} methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:
-1,All { Lock} implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in The Java Language Specification, Third Edition (17.4 Memory Model)
-1,@param sortOrder new sort order. The comparator must be able to support being used in a background thread.
914,This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result. Failure to do this may result in an {@link SWTException} being thrown.
1480,Likewise any application that updates an IPreferenceStore from a Thread other than the UI Thread should be aware of any listeners that require an update in the UI Thread.
-1,It is recommended practice to always immediately follow a call to { lock} with a { try} block, most typically in a before/after construction
10697,ttempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
5572,Note that in context based mode the content formatter is fully reentrant, but not thread-safe.

-1,Formats are generally not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
10705,Attempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
18192,Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result will be inaccurate.
18612,If this write lock is not held when any {@link Condition} method is called then an {@link IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown. (Read locks are held independently of write locks, so are not checked or affected. However it is essentially always an error to invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread has also acquired read locks, since other threads that could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write lock.)
-1,Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a { ConcurrentMap} as a key or value happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that object from the { ConcurrentMap} in another thread.
-1,Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection.
-1,Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not spin in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with fast-path checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended} and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended.
5573,This method is fully reentrant, but not thread-safe.
17694,If the preferences or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a fuzzy snapshot of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.

568,This can be called even after the dialog is closed.
11735,An application should catch instances of this class only if it must clean up after being terminated asynchronously.
15292,The instanceof operator should be used to determine the specific kind of object returned.
15644,Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality. For example: URL url = new URL(jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/); JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection(); Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest();
-1,@return the object fetched. The instanceof operator should be used to determine the specific kind of object returned.
-1,If your application requires specific properties to be set when objects are activated in the group, the application should create a special Properties object containing these properties, then create an ActivationGroupDesc with the Properties object, and use ActivationGroup.createGroup before creating any ActivationDescs (before the default ActivationGroupDesc is created).
10752,This field should be documented with a serialField tag.
11123,@serialData Overriding methods should use this tag to describe the data layout of this Externalizable object.
-1,A piped input stream should be connected to a piped output stream; the piped input stream then provides whatever data bytes are written to the piped output stream.
-1,Security note: If an application needs to read a password or other secure data, it should use {@link #readPassword()} or {@link #readPassword(String, Object...)} and manually zero the returned character array after processing to minimize the lifetime of sensitive data in memory.
-1,Classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it is read from the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature. ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;
-1,Serializable classes that need to designate an alternative object to be used when writing an object to the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature: ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;
12519,An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
11832,As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.
-1,The Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to receive formatted output from a {@link java.util.Formatter}.
-1,An application should not normally try to catch ThreadDeath unless it must do some extraordinary cleanup operation (note that the throwing of ThreadDeath causes finally clauses of try statements to be executed before the thread officially dies). If a catch clause catches a ThreadDeath object, it is important to rethrow the object so that the thread actually dies.
-1,To create a custom mapping, a programmer must do two things: * create a class that implements the {@link SQLData} interface for the UDT to be custom mapped. * make an entry in a type map that contains o the fully-qualified SQL type name of the UDT o the Class object for the class implementing SQLData
14726,Additional columns beyond the columns defined to be returned by the ResultSet object for a given method can be defined by the JDBC driver vendor and must be accessed by their column label.
-1,If auto-commit mode has been disabled, the method commit must be called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
13524,First, if the strings to be collated contain combining sequences that may not be in canonical order, you should set the collator to CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION or FULL_DECOMPOSITION to enable sorting of combining sequences.

-1,Each class that implements PrivilegedAction should document what (if anything) this value represents.
20447,Each subclass should state the precise behavior of this method so that users and developers know what to expect.
19846,Note that digest objects can compute only one digest (see {@link MessageDigest}), so that in order to compute intermediate digests, a caller should retain a handle onto the digest object, and clone it for each digest to be computed, leaving the orginal digest untouched.
8396,No check is made that the object is immutable. In general, only immutable objects should use the constant factory.
8474,No check is made that the object is immutable. In general, only immutable objects should use the constant factory.
19567,Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection.
19753,A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its key factory
-1,Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x).
-1,Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(String parameterName, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(String parameterName, Object x).
-1,To be portable, however, applications should always provide these values for user-named and REF parameters.
-1,In this case, the caller can still decide to show the window, but the window should include some sort of visual warning.
-1,This is important because classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.
11833,Compiler vendors should document the warning names they support in conjunction with this annotation type.

-1,If it is critical to obtain every active subgroup in this thread group, the caller should verify that the returned int value is strictly less than the length of list.
-1,As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
13408,An implementation should document when this is the case.

-1,Note that the default implementation is not very efficient and should be overridden if this class is implemented.
-1,While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied. In other words, waits should always occur in loops, like this one: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(timeout); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
-1,As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop: synchronized (obj) { while (<condition does not hold>) obj.wait(timeout, nanos); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition }
-1,For some memory pools, for example, when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine the current memory usage. An implementation should document when this is the case.
-1,Environment variables should be used when a global effect is desired, or when an external system interface requires an environment variable (such as PATH).
-1,Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
-1,An application remotely accesses the platform MXBeans using proxy should prepare to catch IOException as if accessing with the MBeanServerConnector interface.
-1,When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans for a running virtual machine whose version is different than the version on which the application is running, it should prepare to catch {@link java.io.InvalidObjectException InvalidObjectException} which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in the client application.
-1,The specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is capable of throwing such exceptions.
-1,The StringBuilder class should generally be used in preference to this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as it performs no synchronization.
927,Implementers should document whether the runnable is run synchronously (blocking) or asynchronously (non-blocking), or if no assumption can be made about the blocking behaviour.
5303,Implementers should ignore the text returned by {@link IInformationProvider#getInformation(ITextViewer, IRegion)}.
-1,This method may be called frequently, so implementors should ensure it returns quickly, e.g. by caching the returned creator.
-1,This map is designed for performance and can outstrip HashMap. It also has good garbage collection characteristics. * Optimised for operation at size 3 or less. * Still works well once size 3 exceeded. * Gets at size 3 or less are about 0-10% faster than HashMap, * Puts at size 3 or less are over 4 times faster than HashMap. * Performance 5% slower than HashMap once size 3 exceeded once.
-1,This list implementation utilises a tree structure internally to ensure that all insertions and removals are O(log n). This provides much faster performance than both an ArrayList and a LinkedList where elements are inserted and removed repeatedly from anywhere in the list.
-1,ArrayList is a good general purpose list implementation. It is faster than TreeList for most operations except inserting and removing in the middle of the list. ArrayList also uses less memory as TreeList uses one object per entry.

13411,An implementation should document when this is the case.
18838,In order both to sign and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to normalize it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements, and finally repack the signed JAR.
17599,In general SEVERE messages should describe events that are of considerable importance and which will prevent normal program execution. They should be reasonably intelligible to end users and to system administrators.

-1,Finally, unlike {@link java.util.HashMap}-style implementations, this class never rehashes the map. The number of buckets is fixed at construction time and never altered. Performance may degrade if you do not allocate enough buckets upfront.
-1,he number of buckets is inversely proportional to the chances for thread contention. The fewer buckets, the more chances for thread contention. The more buckets the fewer chances for thread contention.
-1,The {@link #atomic(Runnable)} method is provided to allow atomic iterations and bulk operations; however, overuse of {@link #atomic(Runnable) atomic} will basically result in a map that's slower than an ordinary synchronized {@link java.util.HashMap}.
17600,In general WARNING messages should describe events that will be of interest to end users or system managers, or which indicate potential problems.
17601,So the INFO level should only be used for reasonably significant messages that will make sense to end users and system admins.
-1,In general the FINE level should be used for information that will be broadly interesting to developers who do not have a specialized interest in the specific subsystem.
-1,Both packing steps should use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also need to be set to -1, to prevent accidental variation of segment boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.
-1,Valuable data should not be stored at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it.
8916,The add methods are affected by this class. Thus objects must be removed or searched for using their transformed form. For example, if the transformation converts Strings to Integers, you must use the Integer form to remove objects.

-1,Therefore, if a logging Handler wants to pass off a LogRecord to another thread, or to transmit it over RMI, and if it wishes to subsequently obtain method name or class name information it should call one of getSourceClassName or getSourceMethodName to force the values to be filled in.
-1,Every Queue implementation must specify its ordering properties.
-1,To be portable, however, applications should always provide these values for user-defined and REF parameters.
-1,Compilers must ignore any warning names they do not recognize.
14692,JDBC 4.0 Drivers must include the file META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver.

-1,For some memory pools, this method may be an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine the estimate.
12235,If a method is annotated with this annotation type but does not override a superclass method, compilers are required to generate an error message.
12208,There is no requirement that a process represented by a Process object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect to the Java process that owns the Process object.
12182,Note that the amount of memory required to hold an object of any given type may be implementation-dependent.
12162,A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught.
-1,A driver may only report true here if it passes the JDBC compliance tests; otherwise it is required to return false.JDBC compliance requires full support for the JDBC API and full support for SQL 92 Entry Level. It is expected that JDBC compliant drivers will be available for all the major commercial databases.
18190,Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is not a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these sets, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements.

-1,For example, some List implementations provide asymptotically linear access times if they get huge, but constant access times in practice. Such a List implementation should generally implement this interface.
-1,As a rule, the equals method should be used by implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
-1,Beware that, unlike in most collections, the { size} method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements.
-1,Sets a new selection for this viewer and optionally makes it visible. The TableViewer implementation of this method is inefficient for the ILazyContentProvider as lookup is done by indices rather than elements and may require population of the entire table in worse case.Use Table#setSelection(int[] indices) and Table#showSelection() if you wish to set selection more efficiently when using a ILazyContentProvider.
553,It is strongly recommended that a cancel option be provided, so that the user has the option of making the decision at a later point in time.
99,IDialogConstants is the interface for common dialog strings and ids used throughout JFace. It is recommended that you use these labels and ids whereever for consistency with the JFace dialogs.

-1,Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to document their implementation's behavior with respect to the stackSize parameter.
-1,Code generators are encouraged to use platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions, where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of Math methods. Such higher-performance implementations still must conform to the specification for Math.
13064,It is a compile-time error for a single ElementType constant to appear more than once in a Target annotation.
-1,Caching the state is important to improve overall performance as calling {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.quickassist.IQuickAssistAssistant#canFix(Annotation)} can be expensive.
3847,Disables randomization and enables additional runtime error checking. Severely degrades performance if set to true. Intended for use in test suites only.
-1,Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can help reduce the backlog of incoming data.
18793,Specifying this flag may impose a performance penalty.
11560,Note: The object returned from this method may be an instance of an implementation-specific class. The RemoteObject class ensures serialization portability of its instances' remote references through the behavior of its custom writeObject and readObject methods. An instance of RemoteRef should not be serialized outside of its RemoteObject wrapper instance or the result may be unportable.
