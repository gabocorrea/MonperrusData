So using the pattern MM/dd/yyyy, 01/11/12 parses to\n         Jan 11, 12 A.D.\n     <li>For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern (y or yy),\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> must interpret the abbreviated year\n         relative to some century.  It does this by adjusting dates to be\n         within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>\n         instance is created. For example, using a pattern of MM/dd/yy and a\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> instance created on Jan 1, 1997,  the string\n         01/11/12 would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string 05/04/64\n         would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.\n         During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by\n         {@link Character#isDigit(char)}, will be parsed into the default century.\n         Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit\n         string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, -1), is\n         interpreted literally.  So 01/02/3 or 01/02/003 are parsed, using the\n         same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD.  Likewise, 01/02/-3 is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.\n     </ul>\n     Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.\n     For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern\n     letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific {@linkplain\n     Calendar#LONG long form} is used. Otherwise, a calendar\n     specific {@linkplain Calendar#SHORT short or abbreviated form}\n     is used.\n <li><strong><a name=month>Month:</a></strong>\n     If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is\n     interpreted as <a href=#text>text</a>; otherwise,\n     it is interpreted as a <a href=#number>number</a>.\n <li><strong><a name=timezone>General time zone:</a></strong>\n     Time zones are interpreted as <a href=#text>text</a> if they have\n     names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the\n     following syntax is used:\n     <pre>\n     <a name=GMTOffsetTimeZone><i>GMTOffsetTimeZone:</i></a>\n             <code>GMT</code> <i>Sign</i> <i>Hours</i> <code>:</code> <i>Minutes</i>\n     <i>Sign:</i> one of\n             <code>+ -</code>\n     <i>Hours:</i>\n             <i>Digit</i>\n             <i>Digit</i> <i>Digit</i>\n     <i>Minutes:</i>\n             <i>Digit</i> <i>Digit</i>\n     <i>Digit:</i> one of\n             <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code></pre>\n     <i>Hours</i> must be between 0 and 23, and <i>Minutes</i> must be between\n     00 and 59.

So using the pattern MM/dd/yyyy, 01/11/12 parses to\n         Jan 11, 12 A.D.\n     <li>For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern (y or yy),\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> must interpret the abbreviated year\n         relative to some century.  It does this by adjusting dates to be\n         within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>\n         instance is created. For example, using a pattern of MM/dd/yy and a\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> instance created on Jan 1, 1997,  the string\n         01/11/12 would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string 05/04/64\n         would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.\n         During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by\n         {@link Character#isDigit(char)}, will be parsed into the default century.\n         Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit\n         string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, -1), is\n         interpreted literally.  So 01/02/3 or 01/02/003 are parsed, using the\n         same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD.  Likewise, 01/02/-3 is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.\n     </ul>\n     Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.\n     For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern\n     letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific {@linkplain\n     Calendar#LONG long form} is used. Otherwise, a calendar\n     specific {@linkplain Calendar#SHORT short or abbreviated form}\n     is used.\n <li><strong><a name=month>Month:</a></strong>\n     If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is\n     interpreted as <a href=#text>text</a>; otherwise,\n     it is interpreted as a <a href=#number>number</a>.\n <li><strong><a name=timezone>General time zone:</a></strong>\n     Time zones are interpreted as <a href=#text>text</a> if they have\n     names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the\n     following syntax is used:\n     <pre>\n     <a name=GMTOffsetTimeZone><i>GMTOffsetTimeZone:</i></a>\n             <code>GMT</code> <i>Sign</i> <i>Hours</i> <code>:</code> <i>Minutes</i>\n     <i>Sign:</i> one of\n             <code>+ -</code>\n     <i>Hours:</i>\n             <i>Digit</i>\n             <i>Digit</i> <i>Digit</i>\n     <i>Minutes:</i>\n             <i>Digit</i> <i>Digit</i>\n     <i>Digit:</i> one of\n             <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code></pre>\n     <i>Hours</i> must be between 0 and 23, and <i>Minutes</i> must be between\n     00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken\n     from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard.\n     <p>For parsing, <a href=#rfc822timezone>RFC 822 time zones</a> are also\n     accepted.\n <li><strong><a name=rfc822timezone>RFC 822 time zone:</a></strong>\n     For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:\n     <pre>\n     <i>RFC822TimeZone:</i>\n             <i>Sign</i> <i>TwoDigitHours</i> <i>Minutes</i>\n     <i>TwoDigitHours:</i>\n             <i>Digit Digit</i></pre>\n     <i>TwoDigitHours</i> must be between 00 and 23.

14357,Method Implementation Directive,java/sql/SQLData/readSQL/SQLInput;String,The implementation of the method must follow this protocol: * It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL type from the given input stream. This is done by calling a method of the input stream to read each item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition of the type. * The method readSQL then assigns the data to appropriate fields or elements (of this or other objects). Specifically, it must call the appropriate reader method (SQLInput.readString, SQLInput.readBigDecimal, and so on) method(s) to do the following: for a distinct type, read its single data element; for a structured type, read a value for each attribute of the SQL type.  ,1

12241,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/Object/hashCode/,The general contract of hashCode is: * Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. * If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. * It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables. ,1

If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null, then the SocketPermission constructed with this object's host must imply the SocketPermission constructed with codesource's host. 5. If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal codesource's port. 6. If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal codesource's file, then the following checks are made: If this object's file ends with /-", then codesource's file must start with this object's file (exclusive the trailing "-"). If this object's file ends with a "/*"

13123,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/reflect/Proxy/isProxyClass/Class,The reliability of this method is important for the ability to use it to make security decisions, so its implementation should not just test if the class in question extends Proxy.,1

20351,Method Implementation Directive,java/security/cert/PKIXCertPathChecker,A PKIXCertPathChecker implementation must support reverse checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the reverse direction) and may support forward checking (the ability to perform its checks when it is presented with certificates in the forward direction).,1
##0.0#;(#)</code> produces precisely\n the same behavior as <code>#,Method Implementation Directive,java/text/DecimalFormat, For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the suffixes must be distinct for DecimalFormat.parse() to be able to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then DecimalFormat will behave as if no negative subpattern was specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and thousands separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.  ,1

7503,Method Implementation Directive,org/apache/commons/collections/Bag/remove/Object,According to the {@link Collection#remove(Object)} method, this method should only remove the first occurrence of the given object, not all occurrences. ,1
7762,Method Implementation Directive,org/apache/commons/collections/ListUtils/subtract/List;List,This differs from {@link List#removeAll(Collection)} in that cardinality is respected; if list1 contains two occurrences of null and list2 only contains one occurrence, then the returned list will still contain one occurrence.,1
15010,Method Implementation Directive,java/sql/Connection/setClientInfo/String;String,The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the database. For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column. For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared. Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway. The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only.\n\nThe driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver. ,1
15010,Method Implementation Directive,java/sql/Connection/setClientInfo/String;String,Drivers are not required to support these properties however if the driver supports a client info property that can be described by one of the standard properties, the standard property name should be used. ,1
13307,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation/appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch/JarFile,The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if it implements a method named appendToClassPathForInstrumentation which takes a single parameter of type java.lang.String. The method is not required to have public access.,1
13307,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation/appendToSystemClassLoaderSearch/JarFile,The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class loader for the purpose of instrumentation. Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected behaviour that is difficult to diagnose (see {@link #appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch}. ,1
13249,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/reflect/Constructor/newInstance/Object[],If the required access and argument checks succeed and the instantiation will proceed, the constructor's declaring class is initialized if it has not already been initialized. ,1

16734,Method Implementation Directive,java/util/IdentityHashMap/keySet/,The hashCode method of the returned set returns the sum of the identity hashcodes of the elements in the set, rather than the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the equals method, in order to enforce the general contract of the Object.hashCode method among sets returned by this method.,1
12584,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/Comparable/compareTo/Object,It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). ,1
12330,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/Math/copySign/float;float,Note that unlike the {@link StrictMath#copySign(float, float) StrictMath.copySign} method, this method does not require NaN sign arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN arguments as negative to allow greater performance. ,1

12284,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/Math,Unlike some of the numeric methods of class StrictMath, all implementations of the equivalent functions of class Math are not defined to return the bit-for-bit same results. This relaxation permits better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is not required. ,1
12284,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/Math,Therefore, most methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise, whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the floating-point approximation. ,1
12018,Method Implementation Directive,java/lang/StrictMath,To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of some of the numeric functions in this package require that they produce the same results as certain published algorithms. These algorithms are available from the well-known network library netlib as the package Freely Distributable Math Library, fdlibm.

19862,Method Implementation Directive,java/security/CodeSource/equals/Object,Two CodeSource objects are considered equal if their locations are of identical value and if their signer certificate chains are of identical value. It is not required that the certificate chains be in the same order.,1
19245,Method Implementation Directive,java/math/BigInteger/toByteArray/, The byte array will be in big-endian byte-order: the most significant byte is in the zeroth element.

So using the pattern MM/dd/yyyy, 01/11/12 parses to\n         Jan 11, 12 A.D.\n     <li>For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern (y or yy),\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> must interpret the abbreviated year\n         relative to some century.  It does this by adjusting dates to be\n         within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>\n         instance is created. For example, using a pattern of MM/dd/yy and a\n         <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> instance created on Jan 1, 1997,  the string\n         01/11/12 would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string 05/04/64\n         would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.\n         During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by\n         {@link Character#isDigit(char)}, will be parsed into the default century.\n         Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit\n         string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, -1), is\n         interpreted literally.  So 01/02/3 or 01/02/003 are parsed, using the\n         same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD.  Likewise, 01/02/-3 is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.\n     </ul>\n     Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied.\n     For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern\n     letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific {@linkplain\n     Calendar#LONG long form} is used.

1480,Synchronization Directive,org/eclipse/jface/preference/IPreferenceStore/addPropertyChangeListener/IPropertyChangeListener, Likewise any application that updates an IPreferenceStore from a Thread other than the UI Thread should be aware of any listeners that require an update in the UI Thread. ,4
18617,Synchronization Directive,java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock,It is recommended practice to always immediately follow a call to { lock} with a { try} block, most typically in a before/after construction,4

18612,Synchronization Directive,java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock/WriteLock/newCondition/,If this write lock is not held when any {@link Condition} method is called then an {@link IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown. (Read locks are held independently of write locks, so are not checked or affected. However it is essentially always an error to invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread has also acquired read locks, since other threads that could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write lock.) ,4
18279,Synchronization Directive,java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap,Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a { ConcurrentMap} as a key or value happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that object from the { ConcurrentMap} in another thread. ,4
19572,Synchronization Directive,java/security/PermissionCollection,Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection. ,4
18666,Synchronization Directive,java/util/concurrent/locks/AbstractQueuedSynchronizer,Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held
